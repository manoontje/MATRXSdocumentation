# Changes compared to dev branch
- Added vis_bg colour option for visualization


# New features
- Water, traversable for drones but not cars?
- add_multiple_objects location, colour, for all
- auto refresh screen on new run

# possible improvements
- enable a multi-tick movement animation in the visualization for slow movements. Now it is just a couple ticks of waiting, and then in 1 tick the animation/movement.
