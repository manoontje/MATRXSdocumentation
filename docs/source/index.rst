MATRXS's documentation
======================

Welcome! This is the documentation for Man-Agent Teaming; Rapid Experimentation Software (MATRXS).

MATRXS a 2D-discrete testbed to facilitate Human Agent Teaming (HAT) research. The original use case in MATRXS is an urban search and rescue operation in which pairs of a human and an autonomous system have to locate and rescue victims. However, MATRXS is very versatile and can, therefore, also be used in many other cases.
